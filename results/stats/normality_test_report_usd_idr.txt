# Robust Normality Tests for USD/IDR Exchange Rate
## Analysis of USD/IDR Exchange Rate Distribution Before and After Presidential Inauguration (January 20, 2025)

This report presents the results of robust normality tests on USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025.

### About Normality Tests
Normality is a key assumption in many statistical tests. Testing for normality helps determine whether parametric tests (which assume normal distribution) or non-parametric tests (which don't require normality) are more appropriate for the data. This analysis employs multiple robust normality tests:

1. **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Effective for sample sizes up to 2000. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed.

2. **Anderson-Darling Test**: Places more weight on the tails of the distribution, making it particularly sensitive to deviations from normality in the tails.

3. **Jarque-Bera Test**: Based on skewness and kurtosis, this test is particularly effective for detecting deviations from normality due to asymmetry or heavy tails.

4. **D'Agostino-Pearson Test**: Combines skewness and kurtosis to form an omnibus test of normality.

5. **Lilliefors Test**: A modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that is appropriate when the parameters of the normal distribution are estimated from the data.

## Interpretation Summary

The normality tests provide a basis for determining whether the USD/IDR exchange rate data follows a normal distribution in each period. This information is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical tests for further analysis:

- **If data is normally distributed**: Parametric tests like t-tests and ANOVA may be appropriate.
- **If data is not normally distributed**: Non-parametric tests like Mann-Whitney U, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are more appropriate.

Financial data, including exchange rates, often deviates from normality due to:
- Excess kurtosis (fat tails)
- Non-zero skewness (asymmetry)
- Volatility clustering

The robust descriptive statistics provide additional insights:
- **Comparison of mean and median**: Large differences indicate asymmetry in the distribution
- **Trimmed means**: Less sensitive to outliers than the regular mean
- **MAD and IQR**: Robust measures of dispersion, less sensitive to outliers than standard deviation
- **Skewness**: Measures the asymmetry of the distribution
- **Kurtosis**: Measures the heaviness of the tails of the distribution

## Conclusion

This comprehensive normality assessment helps guide the selection of appropriate statistical methods for analyzing USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration. Based on these results, the appropriate tests for analyzing differences between the periods can be selected.

Given that financial time series data rarely follows a perfect normal distribution, the robust non-parametric tests performed in parallel analyses (Mann-Whitney U, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Cliff's Delta) are particularly valuable for reliable comparisons between periods.
