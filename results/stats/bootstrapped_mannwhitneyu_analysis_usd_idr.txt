# Bootstrapped Mann-Whitney U Test Analysis of USD/IDR Exchange Rate
## Analysis of USD/IDR Exchange Rate Before and After Presidential Inauguration (January 20, 2025)

This report presents the results of Mann-Whitney U tests comparing USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025. The analysis includes bootstrap resampling for robust confidence intervals.

### About Mann-Whitney U Test
The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test that assesses whether two independent samples come from the same distribution. Unlike the t-test, it does not assume normal distribution of the data, making it suitable for financial data analysis. The test evaluates whether one distribution is stochastically greater than the other.

### Bootstrap Analysis
For each comparison, 10000 bootstrap samples were created by resampling with replacement. This provides more robust estimates and allows calculation of confidence intervals for p-values. A comparison is considered to have "robust significance" if more than 80% of the bootstrap samples show a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05).

## Interpretation Summary

### Pre-Inauguration vs Post-Inauguration Analysis:
- Mean USD/IDR before inauguration: 15892.01 (SD: 249.49)
- Mean USD/IDR after inauguration: 16465.54 (SD: 237.51)
- Percent change: 3.61%
- **Robust statistical significance** - The difference between pre and post-inauguration periods is statistically significant (rejection ratio: 1.00, p-value: 0.0000, 95% CI: [0.0000, 0.0000])


## Conclusion

This bootstrapped Mann-Whitney U test analysis provides a robust assessment of distributional differences in USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025. The bootstrap resampling approach provides confidence intervals that account for sampling variability, giving a more reliable picture of statistical significance.

The Mann-Whitney U test is particularly well-suited for financial data analysis as it:
1. Makes no assumptions about the normality of data distribution
2. Is robust against outliers
3. Detects differences in distribution location (i.e., whether one group tends to have higher or lower values than another)
4. Works well with small sample sizes

The rejection ratio (proportion of bootstrap samples with p < 0.05) provides a measure of the robustness of the results, with higher values indicating stronger evidence against the null hypothesis of no difference between periods.

This analysis may help understand whether the presidential inauguration had a statistically significant impact on the USD/IDR exchange rate, which could be useful for understanding political events' impact on currency markets.

_Note: This analysis focuses on distributional differences rather than specific effect sizes. Correlation does not imply causation, and other factors may have influenced exchange rate movements during this period._
