# Bootstrapped Brown-Forsythe Test Analysis of USD/IDR Exchange Rate
## Analysis of USD/IDR Exchange Rate Variance Before and After Presidential Inauguration (January 20, 2025)

This report presents the results of Brown-Forsythe tests comparing the variance of USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025. The analysis includes bootstrap resampling for robust confidence intervals.

### About Brown-Forsythe Test
The Brown-Forsythe test is a robust test for homogeneity of variances across groups. Unlike the traditional Levene's test which uses deviations from group means, the Brown-Forsythe test uses deviations from group medians, making it more robust against non-normal distributions and outliers. The test evaluates the null hypothesis that the variances of the groups are equal.

### Bootstrap Analysis
For each comparison, 10000 bootstrap samples were created by resampling with replacement. This provides more robust estimates and allows calculation of confidence intervals for p-values. A comparison is considered to have "robust significance" if more than 80% of the bootstrap samples reject the null hypothesis (p < 0.05).

## Interpretation Summary

### Pre-Inauguration vs Post-Inauguration Analysis:
- Variance of USD/IDR before inauguration: 63160.10 (SD: 251.32)
- Variance of USD/IDR after inauguration: 57230.86 (SD: 239.23)
- Variance ratio (post/pre): 0.9061
- **No robust evidence** - There is no robust evidence that the variance differs between pre and post-inauguration periods (rejection ratio: 0.05, p-value: 0.5040, 95% CI: [0.0254, 0.9758])


## Conclusion

This bootstrapped Brown-Forsythe test analysis provides a robust assessment of differences in variance of USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025. The bootstrap resampling approach provides confidence intervals that account for sampling variability, giving a more reliable picture of statistical significance.

The Brown-Forsythe test is particularly well-suited for financial data analysis as it:
1. Makes no assumptions about the normality of data distribution
2. Is robust against outliers by using deviations from the median rather than the mean
3. Specifically tests for differences in variance, which is a key measure of volatility in financial markets
4. Works well even with unequal sample sizes

Changes in variance before and after a political event like a presidential inauguration can indicate changes in market uncertainty and risk. Higher variance generally suggests greater uncertainty and volatility, while lower variance suggests more stable market conditions.

This analysis may help understand whether the presidential inauguration had a significant impact on the volatility of the USD/IDR exchange rate, which could be useful for understanding political events' impact on currency market stability.

_Note: This analysis focuses on differences in variance. Correlation does not imply causation, and other factors may have influenced exchange rate volatility during this period._
