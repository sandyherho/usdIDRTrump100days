# Bootstrapped Cliff's Delta Analysis of USD/IDR Exchange Rate
## Analysis of USD/IDR Exchange Rate Before and After Presidential Inauguration (January 20, 2025)

This report presents the results of Cliff's Delta effect size measure comparing USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025. The analysis includes bootstrap resampling for robust confidence intervals.

### About Cliff's Delta
Cliff's Delta is a non-parametric effect size measure that quantifies the amount of difference between two groups of observations. The measure ranges from -1 to 1, where:
- Values near 0 indicate negligible difference between groups
- Values near 1 indicate that values in the first group tend to be larger than those in the second group
- Values near -1 indicate that values in the second group tend to be larger than those in the first group

Cliff's Delta is interpreted according to these thresholds:
- |d| < 0.147: Negligible effect
- 0.147 ≤ |d| < 0.33: Small effect
- 0.33 ≤ |d| < 0.474: Medium effect
- |d| ≥ 0.474: Large effect

### Bootstrap Analysis
For each comparison, 10000 bootstrap samples were created by resampling with replacement. This provides more robust estimates and allows calculation of confidence intervals for the effect size.

## Interpretation Summary

### Pre-Inauguration vs Post-Inauguration Analysis:
- Mean USD/IDR before inauguration: 15892.01 (SD: 249.49)
- Mean USD/IDR after inauguration: 16465.54 (SD: 237.51)
- Percent change: 3.61%
- Cliff's Delta: -0.9224 (Large effect), 95% CI: [-0.9727, -0.8571]
- This negative delta indicates that USD/IDR values tend to be **lower** after the inauguration.


## Conclusion

This bootstrapped Cliff's Delta analysis provides a robust assessment of the magnitude of differences in USD/IDR exchange rates before and after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025. The bootstrap resampling approach provides confidence intervals that account for sampling variability, giving a more reliable picture of the effect size.

Cliff's Delta is particularly well-suited for financial data analysis as it:
1. Makes no assumptions about the underlying distributions
2. Is robust against outliers
3. Quantifies not just whether there is a difference, but how substantial that difference is
4. Provides an intuitive measure of how often values in one group exceed values in another group

Unlike hypothesis tests that only tell us if there is a statistically significant difference, Cliff's Delta tells us about the size of that difference, which is often more important for practical decision-making.

This analysis may help understand the magnitude of the presidential inauguration's impact on the USD/IDR exchange rate, which could be useful for understanding political events' impact on currency markets.

_Note: This analysis quantifies the magnitude of differences. Correlation does not imply causation, and other factors may have influenced exchange rate movements during this period._
